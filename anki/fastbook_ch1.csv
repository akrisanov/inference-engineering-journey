What is machine learning?,The process of training programs to learn from experience rather than hardcoding logic.
What is deep learning?,A subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks.
What is a neural network?,A model composed of layers of mathematical functions trained to approximate complex solutions.
What is a label in ML?,"The value we're trying to predict, such as 'dog' or 'cat'."
What is a prediction in ML?,"The output of the model when given input data — a replication of labels, not recommendations."
What is an architecture?,The template/structure of a model that defines how data flows through its layers.
What are parameters?,Values in the model (like weights) that are learned during training.
What is training in ML?,The process of updating parameters to minimize loss on the training set.
What does 'fit' mean in ML?,To train a model by adjusting weights so predictions match labels.
What is a pretrained model?,"A model trained on a large dataset, reused and fine-tuned for another task."
What is fine-tuning?,The process of adapting a pretrained model to a specific task by training its head.
What is the head of a model?,The final layers added to a pretrained model to make it suitable for a new task.
What is transfer learning?,Reusing a pretrained model's knowledge for a different but related task.
What is a training set?,The data used to train the model by updating weights.
What is a validation set?,"Data excluded from training, used to evaluate generalization and tune hyperparameters."
What is a test set?,"Data held back completely, used only once for final evaluation of generalization."
Why do we need a test set?,To simulate real-world unseen data and prevent overfitting to the validation set.
When should we not use random splits for validation?,"For time series or datasets with overlapping subjects (e.g., people in images)."
Why is using a test set too early a mistake?,It leads to overfitting by making decisions based on the test results.
What is overfitting?,When a model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns that generalize.
How can validation set leakage cause overfitting?,"If validation data ends up in training, the model may memorize it."
How to avoid overfitting during development?,"Use a test set only once, and monitor performance on a clean validation set."
What are hyperparameters?,"Settings like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs that are not learned from data."
Name 3 examples of hyperparameters.,"Learning rate, dropout rate, number of epochs."
What is weight decay?,A regularization technique to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.
What is the purpose of the optimizer?,To update model weights during training to minimize loss.
What features do early CNN layers learn?,"Edges, textures, simple patterns."
What features do deeper CNN layers learn?,High-level features like object parts and full objects.
What are CNN filters (kernels)?,Learnable patterns that detect features in images at each layer.
What is the learning process in a CNN?,Optimizing filter weights to detect useful patterns via backpropagation.
What is a loss function?,A function used to calculate how wrong predictions are — used for training.
What is a metric?,"A human-readable measure (e.g., accuracy) for evaluating model performance."
How does loss differ from metric?,Loss guides training updates; metrics are for interpretation and reporting.
What is a computational graph?,A structure representing operations and data flow; enables automatic differentiation.
What is dynamic graph execution?,Building the graph on the fly (used in PyTorch); intuitive and flexible.
What is static graph execution?,Defining the graph in advance (used in TensorFlow); more optimized but less flexible.
What is a feedback loop in ML?,"When a model’s predictions influence future data, reinforcing its own biases."
Give an example of a feedback loop in practice.,Predictive policing → more police in one area → more crime reports → loop.
How can feedback loops be dangerous?,They can entrench biases and distort reality based on model predictions.
Name 3 deep learning applications in NLP.,"Question answering, document classification, speech recognition."
Name 3 deep learning applications in CV.,"Object detection, face recognition, interpreting drone imagery."
Name 2 deep learning applications in medicine.,"Tumor detection from scans, diabetic retinopathy diagnosis."
What is one DL application in biology?,"Protein folding (e.g., AlphaFold)."
What are recommendation systems used for?,"Product recommendations, search ranking, homepage personalization."
What is the Universal Approximation Theorem?,A neural network can approximate any function to any accuracy.
What is a GPU and why is it important?,A processor for parallel calculations — ideal for training neural nets.
Why can't we write a traditional program to detect cats?,Too many variations — hard to hardcode all possible patterns.
What’s the best way to avoid failure in AI projects?,"Use a baseline and keep a clean, hidden test set."
