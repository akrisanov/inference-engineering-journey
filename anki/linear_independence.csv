What does it mean for vectors to be linearly dependent?,At least one vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.
What does it mean for vectors to be linearly independent?,None of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.
What is the geometric interpretation of linearly dependent vectors in 2D?,They lie on the same line (are colinear).
What is the geometric interpretation of linearly independent vectors in 2D?,They span the plane — each adds a unique direction.
How can we computationally check for linear independence using PyTorch?,By stacking vectors into a matrix and comparing the matrix rank with the number of vectors.
What does matrix rank represent in this context?,The number of linearly independent vectors — the dimension of the space they span.
What is the condition for linear dependence using the zero vector?,A set is linearly dependent if c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + ... + cₙvₙ = 0 has a nontrivial solution (not all cᵢ = 0).
What does it mean when the rank of a matrix formed by vectors is less than the number of vectors?,The vectors are linearly dependent — some are redundant.
Why does a set of 3 vectors in ℝ² have to be linearly dependent?,Because at most 2 vectors can span ℝ²; the third must be a combination of the first two.
Why is linear independence important when defining a basis?,Because a basis must consist of vectors that uniquely span the space — no vector should be redundant.
What is the relationship between matrix rank and basis?,The rank gives the number of independent vectors — the size of the largest basis you can form from the set.
"Are the vectors [2,3] and [4,6] linearly dependent or independent?",Dependent — they are colinear and one is a multiple of the other.
"Are the vectors [7,0] and [0,-1] linearly dependent or independent?",Independent — they point in orthogonal directions.
"Why is [1,2] redundant in the set {[2,1], [3,2], [1,2]}?",It can be written as a linear combination of the other two vectors — the set is dependent.
How do we determine whether a set of vectors spans ℝ³?,"Check if any vector in ℝ³ can be written as a combination of the vectors — i.e., solve the system of equations."
What does it mean when a set of 3 vectors in ℝ³ has a nonzero solution to c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃ = 0?,The vectors are linearly dependent — some are redundant.
What does it mean when the only solution to c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃ = 0 is c₁ = c₂ = c₃ = 0?,The vectors are linearly independent — no redundancy.
Why is linear independence important in deep learning?,Independent features carry unique information and help avoid redundancy and numerical instability.
What is the connection between linear independence and feature selection?,Independent features contribute new information — dependent ones may be redundant or correlated.
