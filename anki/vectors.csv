What is a vector in linear algebra?,An ordered list of numbers that represents a quantity with both magnitude and direction.
What is a vector in computer science (in the context of ML)?,"An ordered list of numbers, often representing features of a data point."
What is the geometric interpretation of a vector?,A directed arrow from the origin to a point in space.
How does vector addition work geometrically?,By placing the tail of the second vector at the head of the first and drawing a new vector from the origin to the end point.
What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar greater than 1?,"The vector’s length increases, but its direction stays the same."
What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar between 0 and 1?,"The vector’s length decreases, but its direction stays the same."
What happens when you multiply a vector by a negative scalar?,The vector’s length changes and its direction reverses.
How can vectors be used in machine learning?,They can represent feature sets for data points.
How do you calculate the length (magnitude) of a vector?,By taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.
What’s the difference between scalar multiplication and the dot product?,Scalar multiplication multiplies each vector component by the scalar; the dot product multiplies corresponding components of two vectors and sums the results.
Why are vectors important in deep learning?,They are the basic building blocks for representing and processing data in models.
