# Classification and Regression

A **classification model** is one that attempts to predict a class, or category. It's predicting from a number of discrete possibilities, such as "dog" or "cat."

 A **regression model** is one that attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as a temperature or a location.

> Don't use the word "regression" to refer to a particular kind of model called a *linear regression model*.
