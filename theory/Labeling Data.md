# Labeling Data

## Computer Vision

Computer vision datasets are normally structured in such a way that the label for an image is part of the filename or pathâ€”most commonly the parent folder name.

For example, the file `great_pyrenees_173.jpg` is the 173rd example of an image of a Great Pyrenees breed dog in the dataset.

The filenames start with an uppercase letter if the image is a cat, and a lowercase letter otherwise.
