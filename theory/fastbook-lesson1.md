## ðŸ“– Notes from *fastbook* Ch.1

A normal computer program:

In 2012, this is how image recognition was done:

This is the classical ML (pre-deep learning) approach. While it was successful, such projects took
**years**, involved **many people**, required **tons of code**, and relied heavily on **handcrafted math**.

Once the team spent enormous resources building features, they passed them into a machine learning model.

> In deep learning, we don't feed features to a model â€” we ask it to learn them.

---

Deep learning is called *deep* because it stacks multiple layers of transformations. These layers
combine low-level features to form more abstract and complex representations. The deeper the network,
the more sophisticated the features it can extract.

Image-based algorithms aren't just for images. For example, sound classification often begins by
converting audio into images (like spectrograms), which are then processed using vision models.

> ðŸ’¡ With some creativity, we can do a lot of things with images.

This general approach works for many real-world tasks.

Computer vision isnâ€™t just for object recognition â€” it's broadly applicable to classification problems.

---

Another powerful use case is **tabular data analysis**.
Unlike with vision or NLP, there arenâ€™t standard pre-trained models for tabular problems â€” because
every table is different. Thatâ€™s why fine-tuning makes less sense here. Instead, we usually train
from scratch using simple `.fit()` methods.

---

**Collaborative filtering** is the basis for most modern recommendation systems.
We try to predict what other products a user might like by identifying similar users and seeing what theyâ€™ve liked.

---

`MSE` (Mean Squared Error) tells us how far, on average, our predictions are from the validation set.

A model is just a mathematical function â€” it wonâ€™t do anything useful until its weights are carefully tuned.

![](assets/Screenshot%202025-08-02%20at%2016.05.53.png)

We measure how good the model is by calculating the **loss**.
Then, we **iterate** to improve performance â€” often measured with metrics like accuracy.

> How do we define the `update` step that improves our model?

---

Once the model is trained, we no longer need the loss function â€” we just save the weights and integrate
them into the model for inference. From that point on, using the model is similar to calling any
other function in a program.
