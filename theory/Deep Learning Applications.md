# Deep Learning Applications

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Answering questions
- Speech recognition
- Summarizing documents
- Classifying documents
- Extracting names, dates, and other entities from text
- Searching for articles that mention a concept

## Computer Vision (CV)

- Interpreting satellite and drone imagery (e.g., for disaster resilience)
