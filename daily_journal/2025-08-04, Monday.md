## üéØ Goals for Today

- [x] Read [Jupyter Notebook 101](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/jupyter-notebook-101), especially the tips and tricks section
- [x] Read [Kaggle](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/kaggle.html)
- [x] Copy and fix issues in the [Is it a bird? Creating a model from your own data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akrisanov/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data/)
- [x] Train a custom image classifier to distinguish between sea and lake photos using fastai
- [x] Read [Providing a Good Education in Deep Learning](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2016-10-08-teaching-philosophy.html)
- [x] Read fast.ai Book: Your First Model

## üìñ What I Studied

- How to use Jupyter notebooks (already familiar with the tool)
- How to train my own image classifier using the fastai library and provided code snippets

## üí° Insights and Reflections

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is the world‚Äôs largest data science community
- Jupyter is a convenient and powerful tool for experimentation and sharing results
- Nearly all technical subjects at university are taught *bottom-up*, fast.ai takes the opposite approach: complete solution to a real-world problem ‚Üí basic foundations
- fast.ai notebooks on Kaggle can be broken due to dependency issues (classic) ‚Üí spent ~1 hour fixing the ["Is it a bird?" notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akrisanov/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data/)
- `DataLoaders` is an object containing *a training set*
- *A training set* is data used to create a model
- *A validation set* is data used to check *the accuracy* of a model
- `blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock)` ‚Äì the inputs to our model are images, and the outputs are categories, e.g. "bird" or "forest"
- `valid_pct=0.2` ‚Äì uses 20% of the data as the validation set
- `resnet18` is no longer the fastest widely used computer vision model ‚Üí [Computer Vision Models](../theory/Computer%20Vision%20Models.md)
- `fastai` provides a convenient `fine_tune()` method that applies best practices for fine-tuning a pre-trained model
- *Fine-tuning a model* means taking a pre-trained model and adjusting the weights so it learns to recognize your specific dataset. For example, we can take a model trained on *ImageNet* (a widely used CV dataset with 1,000 categories) and fine-tune it for our use case
- We can use latest advanced in transfer learning to fine-tune a model
- While your model is training, you can read the next section of the book or take notes ‚Äì don't waste too much time
- Error rate ‚Äì the proportion of images that were incorrectly identified

## ‚ùì Questions

- How are the training and validation sets built using `valid_pct=0.2`?
- What kind of validation strategy is used ‚Äî is the data shuffled before splitting?
- What image transformations (augments) are applied by default? How can I customize them
- How does fastai infer labels from filenames or folder names?
- What happens if labels are noisy or inconsistent in the dataset?
- How does `fastai` decide on learning rate during `fine_tune()`?
- What are the trade-offs between `resnet18`, `resnet34`, `resnet50` for a small custom dataset?
- How can I export the trained model and use it outside the notebook?
