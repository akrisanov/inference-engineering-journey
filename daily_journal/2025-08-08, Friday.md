- [x] Review notes from Week 1
- [x] Anki practice ‚Äî focus on definitions & core concepts from _What is ML_ and _Neural Networks_
- [x] Read [[meta learning how to learn deep learning and thrive in the digital world notes.pdf|notes on learning deep learning]]

## üìñ What I Studied

- Unit vectors
- Basis of the coordinate system
- Linear combination
- Vectors vs points
- Span in three-dimensional space
- Linearly dependent vectors vs linearly independent vectors

## üí° Insights and Reflections

- We can think about each coordinate as a scalar ‚Üí it stretches or compresses the corresponding basis vector
- $\hat{\mathbf{i}}$ ‚Äî "i-hat" or the unit vector in the $x$ direction
- $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$ ‚Äî "j-hat" or the unit vector in the $y$ direction
- $x$ coordinate is a _scalar_ that stretches $\hat{\mathbf{i}}$ by some factor
- $y$ coordinate is a _scalar_ that stretches $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$ by some factor
- These two coordinates describe the sum of two scaled vectors
- For vector $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}$, the sum is $(3\hat{\mathbf{i}}) + (-2\hat{\mathbf{j}})$
- $\hat{\mathbf{i}}$, $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$ are the **basis** of the $xy$ coordinate system
- We can choose different basis vectors -> new completely reasonable coordinate system
- By altering the choice of scalars you can reach every possible two-dimensional vector
- A pair of basis vectors gives us a valid way to go back and forth between coordinates and geometric vectors
- Every time we describe vectors numerically, it depends on implicit choice of what the basis vectors are
- Every time you're scaling two vectors and adding them, it's called the **linear combination** of those vectors: $a\vec{\mathbf{v}} + b\vec{\mathbf{w}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are scalars
- Why "linear"?  If you fix one of the scalars and let another one change its value freely, the tip of the resulting vector draws a straight line
- What if we let two scalars change freely?
  - For most pair of vectors, you'll be able to reach every possible point in the plane
  - When your two original vectors happen to line up, the tip of the resulting vector is limited to just this single line passing through the origin
  - Both original vectors could be zero -> you stuck at the origin
- The set of all possible vectors you can reach with a linear combinations of a given pair of vectors is called the **span** of those two vectors: $a\vec{\mathbf{v}} + b\vec{\mathbf{w}}$
- We use _vector addition_ and _scalar multiplication_
- If two vectors are lined up, their span is just a line
- Think of individual vector as an arrow
- Think of collection of vectors as points
- The idea of span can be extended to three-dimensional space: $a\vec{\mathbf{v}} + b\vec{\mathbf{w}} + c\vec{\mathbf{u}}$
- For span, let scalar vary
- When you have multiple vectors and you can remove one without reducing the span, those vectors are called _linearly dependent_: $\vec{\mathbf{u}} = a\vec{\mathbf{v}} + b\vec{\mathbf{w}}$
- _At least one_ vector in the set can be expressed as a combination of the others
- If each vector really adds another dimension to the span, they're called **linearly independent**

## ‚ùì Questions

- The technical definition of a **basis** of a space if a set of _linearly independent_ vectors that _span_ the full space. Why is that?
