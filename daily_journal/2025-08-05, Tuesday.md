- [Labeling Data](../theory/Labeling%20Data.md)
- [Classification and Regression](../theory/Classification%20and%20Regression.md)
- [Metrics](../theory/Metrics.md)
- [CNNs](../theory/CNNs.md)

## 💡 Insights and Reflections

- *Overfitting* is the single most important and challenging issue when training for all machine learning practitioners, and all algorithms
- Don't apply methods to avoid overfitting until you have confirmed that *overfitting* is happening (e.g. the validation accuracy getting worse during training)
- Picking a model architecture (such as ResNet) isn't very important part of the deep learning process → use standing architectures that work most of the time
- The `34` in `resnet34` refers to the number of layers in this architecture
  - Other options are `19`, `50`, `101`, and `152`.
  - **More layers → longer to train & more chance of overfitting**
  - *With more data more layers can improve accuracy*
- Don't underestimate usage of pretrained models

## ❓ Questions

- What is the difference between loss function and a metric function?
