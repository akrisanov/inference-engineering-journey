## 💡 Insights and Reflections

### Accessibility of Deep Learning

- Python programmers can get impressive results in deep learning with minimal math, small datasets, and relatively little code.
- Free resources like Khan Academy can help build just enough math intuition to get started.

### What is Deep Learning

> **Deep learning** is a technique for extracting and transforming data using multiple layers of neural networks.

- Each layer receives input from the previous layer and transforms it into more refined representations.
- Layers are trained by minimizing errors — typically via backpropagation.
- The foundational model type is the **neural network**.

### A Brief History of Neural Networks

- **1943** – McCulloch & Pitts: *A neuron can be modeled using simple addition and thresholding.*
- **1950s–60s** – Minsky & Papert: Single-layer perceptrons can’t solve XOR; multi-layer networks overcome this limitation.
- **1986** – Rumelhart, McClelland et al.: The *Parallel Distributed Processing* (PDP) books formalized modern neural nets.
- Neural networks were used in real-world projects in the ’80s and ’90s but were limited by hardware and misunderstanding.
- The breakthrough came with more layers (deep nets), better GPUs, more data, and improved algorithms.

### How to Learn Deep Learning

- The hardest parts are practical and hands-on: knowing if your data is correct, if the model is learning, and what to try next.
- Focus on experimenting and writing code. **Start small, build momentum.**
- If something doesn’t make sense, slow down, re-read, Google for alternatives, and build a bigger picture.
- Apply new concepts to projects tied to your passions or hobbies.
- Start with a few small, simple projects and gradually grow into a bigger one.

> 🧪 The most important part of learning deep learning is **writing code and experimenting**.

### PyTorch, fastai, and the Ecosystem

- Understanding **concepts** is more valuable than memorizing syntax — foundational knowledge is transferable.
- `PyTorch` is a low-level deep learning library that provides maximum flexibility.
- `fastai` builds on top of PyTorch to offer a higher-level API for common tasks like image classification, NLP, etc.
- The deep learning ecosystem evolves quickly — expect libraries and APIs to change over time.

## ❓ Questions

- What exactly is a **neural network** in terms of its structure and math?
- How are layers organized in a neural network?
- How does a model “learn” features without manual input?
- What is backpropagation?
