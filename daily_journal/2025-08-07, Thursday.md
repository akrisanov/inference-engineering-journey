## 🎯 Goals for Today

- [x] Create cards for spaced repetition for fastbook Chapter 1
- [x] Watch [Vectors | Essence of linear algebra](https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs?si=0HMoY53t47wSQvep)

## 📖 What I Studied

- What are vectors
- Vector addition and scalar multiplication

## 💡 Insights and Reflections

- Vectors are **root-of-it-all** in linear algebra
- In CS, a vector is just an ordered list of numbers
- Vectors can be used to visualize data points, e.g., in data analysis or exploration

## ❓ Questions

- What is the geometric interpretation of a vector?
- How does vector addition work geometrically?
- What happens to a vector when it’s multiplied by a scalar >1? Between 0 and 1? Negative?
- *How can vectors be used to represent features in machine learning?*
- How is the length (magnitude) of a vector calculated?
- What’s the difference between scalar multiplication and the dot product?
- Why are vectors important in both linear algebra and deep learning?
