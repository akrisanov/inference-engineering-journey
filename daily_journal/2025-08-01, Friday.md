## 🎯 Goals for Today

- [x] Install Python 3.13.5 via [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html)
- [x] Install VS Code → already installed with a bunch of useful add-ons
- [x] Install Git → already installed with `lazygit`
- [x] Creat a repository → <https://github.com/akrisanov/inference-journey>
- [x] Clone <https://github.com/fastai/fastbook>
- [x] Run first fastbook notebook

## 📖 What I Studied

## 💡 Insights and Reflections

- Jupyter extensions made fast.ai starter easier to follow
- The `fastbook` package is not ready for Python 3.13.x
- PyTorch doesn't support Intel GPU
- Running examples from `01_intro.ipynb` without CUDA on Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 13 (Fedora 42) takes ages

## ❓ Questions

- What’s the difference between *inference* and *training*?
