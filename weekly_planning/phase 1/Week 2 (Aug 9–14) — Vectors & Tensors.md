## Focus

Build intuition for vectors and learn how to work with them as tensors in PyTorch.

## Tasks  

- [ ] ðŸŽ¥ Carry over from Week 1:
	- [Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors](https://youtu.be/k7RM-ot2NWY)
- [ ] Learn: vector addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication
- [ ] In PyTorch:
	- Create 1D, 2D tensors
	- Perform addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication
	- Verify results match math expectations
- [ ] Take notes in Obsidian with definitions, properties, and code examples
